## Status

accepted

## Context

We wish to facilitate sharing trip information with social media. There are different patterns available to us. One such pattern is sharing a link, with content exposed by our own service, based on the [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) protocol.

## Decision

Share links back to our system, sharing Trip representations based on the Open Graph protocol.

## Rationale

### Pros

- Standardised format

### Cons

- Limits the freedom of the implementors

## Consequences

Trips are shared to Social Media based on the Open Graph protocol.
